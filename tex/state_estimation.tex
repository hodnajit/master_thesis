\chap State estimations algorithms for localization
Localisation is the problem of estimating a robotâ€™s coordinates in an external reference frame from sensor data. In particular, probabilistic approaches are typically more robust in the face of sensor limitations, sensor noise or environment dynamics\cite[probabilistic_robotics]. Moreover, they often scale much better to complex and unstructured environments, where the ability to handle uncertainty is of even greater importance\cite[probabilistic_robotics].

For that reason, only probabilistic methods for state estimation are described in the next chapter.
