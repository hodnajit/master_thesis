A various approaches for state estimation were introduced in Chapter \ref[chap-state-est]. The chosen approach is the Error-state extended Kalman filter(ES-EKF), where the error in the states is estimated using a Kalman filter rather than the state itself. The benefits of this approach are briefly summarized in Chapter \ref[chap-state-est].
