\chap Experiments
This chapter is dedicated to the experimental evaluation of the proposed localization system. Firstly, the description of evaluation approaches is given. As the system is tested in real experiments, the second section is dedicated to implementing the localization system on a robotic platform CART2. This section contains a brief introduction to specific IMU, UWB network and wheel encoders, and the robotic platform itself.

The following two sections are dedicated to experiments at two different experimental environments. The first experiments, described in the third section, were realized in a lab at Datavision s.r.o. company\fnote{To find out more about the company follow link: \url{https://datavision.software/}} with an external localization system based on an AprilTag detection with the camera. The external localization system was developed in this thesis for the evaluation of the proposed localization system.

Additional experiments took place in an Intelligent and mobile robotics lab at Czech Technical University in Prague - Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics, where the Vicon reference system is used for evaluation. These experiments are summarized in the fourth section of this chapter.

\sec Description of evaluation
First, it is necessary to determine which variables exhibit the performance of the system well. Then choose the appropriate test scenarios on which to evaluate the behaviour of individual variables. It is good to select a suitable reference system. And perform the entire evaluation on predefined metrics.

The evaluation is focused on four variables, which are
\begitems
* position x,
* position y
* point in 2D space (xy)
* and angle of rotation.
\enditems

It is worth noting that the output of the proposed system is the position in 3D space. However, this work aimed to design a localization in 2D space, and therefore accent is put on these four states. For system evaluation, it is advisable to have an external reference system, which will provide us with reference data with which we can compare the results of the evaluated system. The data from the reference and evaluated systems must have unified timestamps to compare their outputs easily.

Experimental scenarios are chosen so that their difficulty increases. The first tests are performed on a smaller area. Experiments start with a stationary test and simple movements at shorter distances (moving in one axis, rotating on the spot). Then more complex trajectories are approached, such as the following rectangular and infinity shape trajectories. Further experiments are performed in a larger space, where more complex trajectories are tested.

Data from both reference and evaluated systems are then processed as follows. Each reference measurement's timestamp is taken, according to which the nearest measurement can be found in the evaluated data. This filtering is vital for reference systems that have a lower frequency than the proposed localization.

The criteria that interest us are
\begitems
* the evolution of individual variables over time,
* the visualization of the trajectories from both systems
* and the errors of variables versus the reference.
\enditems

These metrics are used to analyze whether the proposed system converges or diverges from reality and whether the system is subject to drift. The analysis of errors according to the root mean square, average, median, minimum and maximum calculation defines the system's resulting accuracy and precision.

All these testing scenarios and metrics are further applied in two test environments.

\sec Used hardware description
This section presents an overview of used sensors for the proposed localization and a description of the CART2 robotic platform used during experiments.
\secc Sensors specification
The onboard sensors of interest are the Inertial Measurement Unit, ultra-wideband localization tag, April tag and encoders on motors.

{\bf Inertial measurement unit} used during experiments is Epson M-G365PDF1 (loaner sample). Epson M-G365 is used in various applications ranging from stabilization systems (as camera gimbal) to navigation systems.

The IMU has six degrees of freedom and measures angular rates and linear accelerations in three axis. It is factory calibrated, and the calibration data are stored in the memory of the unit. Technical specifications of Epson M-G365 can be found at \fnote{Datasheet of Epson M-G365 \url{https://global.epson.com/products_and_drivers/sensing_system/download_hidden/pdf/m-g365pd_datasheet_e_rev20201007.pdf}}, while summary is included in Table \ref[spec_epson]

As I already mentioned in Chapter \ref[chap-sec-avar], the AVAR analysis of IMU sensors can give us a brief overview of IMU's specifications. The experimental setup for static data acquisition can be seen in Figure \ref[fig-epson-avar]. The sensor is mounted on two sponges and fixed with cardboard. The static data were recorded for 48 hours at a frequency of 30.0 Hz. The experiment took place at a village without any subway, trams or trains to reduce external vibrations on measurement (to reduce potential outliers) and at standard room temperature (about 23 °C).

For AVAR computation, I used a python library named AllanTools. For purposes of this thesis, the overlapping Allan deviation function is used.

As shown in Figure \ref[fig-epson-avar2], the external reset of integration of IMU measurement must be performed at 0.01 Hz at the latest. After that period, the non-gaussian noise of accelerometers comes into account. The UWB localization system works at 10 Hz, which should be enough for resetting.

The IMU is set up for the final experiments to publish delta angle and delta velocity at 100 Hz with a moving average filter with tap 64. Because of that, higher frequencies than 10 Hz are filtered, as shown in Figure \ref[fig-epson-filter].

{\bf UWB localization system} is provided by Qorvo's MDEK1001 ultra-wideband development kit. This kit includes 12 DWM1001-DEV development boards in plastic enclosures (see Figure \ref[fig-uwb-dwm]).

Each can be configured as an anchor, tag or bridge node. The system is installed with six anchors fixedly mounted and one tag which is moving. The anchors are higher than the tag. According to the initiator anchor, the tag's position gives the coordinates frame's origin. The setup of the system can be seen in Figure \ref[fig-uwb-anchors_tags].

The anchors should be mounted at the same height and higher than the operating area of the moving tag. They also should not be mounted close to any metal to get the best accuracy. There is a mobile application for the configuration of the network. The positions of the anchors are estimated manually and set in the network configuration.

{\bf The odometry} is computed according to the measurement of encoders in Maxon EPOS4 positioning controllers for Maxon brushless DC motors.

{\bf AprilTag} serves as a global reference of the pose of the CART2 platform. The AprilTag detection software computes the precise 3D position, orientation, and identity of the tags relative to the camera\cite[april_tag]. This tag is similar to QR codes (a type of two-dimensional bar code), but it encodes smaller data payloads (between 4-12 bits), and it can be detected more robustly.

{\bf Camera} used for detection of AprilTag is Niceboy Stream Pro with Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution, 30 FPS, 90 ° field of vision and f/1.8 lens aperture\cite[camera_niceboy].

An image of the utilized CART2 platform can be seen in Figure \ref[fig-cart2_close]. The coordinate frame of CART2 called "baselink"  is illustrated in all Figures \ref[fig-cart2_close] and \ref[fig-cart2_sensors]. The CART2 used for various robotic competitions is a differential drive equipped with the ADlink MXE-210 computer.

The UWB tag is mounted on a wooden stick approximately one meter upon the CART2 platform to reduce reflections of UWB waves from surfaces and the negative influence of any metal part. The AprilTag is mounted below the UWB tag not to become a barrier in the UWB wave. When the AprilTag was mounted on top of the CART2 platform, the wooden stick obstructs the camera detection of AprilTag. Thus I decided to mount it as high as possible to reduce these situations.

{\bf Coordinate systems of CART2 and sensors placements} are illustrated in Figure \ref[fig-cart2_coordinates] and described in Table \ref[cart2_frames]. Note, that world, camera and uwb_base frames are fixed with environment and explained in Section \ref[sec-experiments_bu04].

\sec Experiments in the lab at Datavision s.r.o.
\secc Experimental lab description
	For the first experiments, I created an experimental setup at Datavision s.r.o. with global reference given by camera detection of AprilTag mounted at CART2 platform. The address of the building is Ukrajinská 1487/2a, 101 00 Prague 10 - Vršovice. Dimensions of the room for experiments are approximately 4 x 6 [m], and the camera view area is approximately 2.5 x 4.5 [m]. The setup can be seen in Figure \ref[fig-bu04].

Firstly, UWB anchors need to be mounted and measured their poses according to the world coordinate system. These poses need to be set in the mobile application for the configuration of the UWB network. The world frame coincides with the uwb_base frame in rotation and only differs in z coordinate in translation.

Secondly, the camera needs to be mounted and measured its position according to the world coordinate system. The transform between the world and the camera is not trivial. Because of that, I decided to use the transformation mentioned in Table \ref[bu04_frames] and then computed a camera homography according to a few positions measured by camera detection and by hand. The homography defines the transformation between a planar surface (ground) and a camera image plane. The camera homography is then applied to the AprilTag detection pose, which is considered a global reference. These frames are illustrated in \ref[fig-cart2_coordinates].
	
\secc Description of experiments
	The area for experiments is not big, but I decided that these experiments serve as a proof of concept of the localization idea.

Experiments can be divided based on six simple trajectories of CART2 into
 \begitems
 	* stationary test (stationary test),
 	* rotation above 360 degrees in one direction at one place test (rotation test),
 	* moving in x direction (x test),
 	* moving in y direction (y test),
 	* moving in rectangle shape (rectangle test)
 	* and moving in infinity shape (infinity test).
 \enditems
 I picked a specific initial pose for each testing trajectory to repeatedly make these tests in very similar conditions. Also, rotation, rectangle, and infinity tests ran several times in a row without start/stop of the system to see how it behaves in a "long" term.
 
 Trajectories of these tests and the starting and ending positions of CART2 performing the movement are illustrated in Figure \ref[fig-bu04-traj]. CART2 platform was controlled via keyboard and joystick during experiments. The controlling via keyboard has the benefit of control velocity in each direction easily. Thus I used it for constant speed during simple moving in single-axis and simple rotation around a single axis. With that, I controlled all tests, except the infinity test, where the movement is complex. During the rectangle test, CART2 drove forward (moving in single-axis) then stopped and turned at one place above 90 degrees (rotating above single axis). I controlled the CART2 platform with the joystick in infinity shape movement and tried to move similar velocities as in constant movements. The summary of velocities during experiments is given in Table \ref[bu04_traj_vel].

The next experimental environment was placed at Czech Technical University in Prague – Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics (CIIRC) in the Intelligent and mobile robotics lab. The localization system was evaluated using the VICON external camera localization system \cite[vicon]. The VICON defines the world frame. UWB localization is installed with six anchors, and their positions are defined in a world frame. The setup is illustrated in Figure \ref[fig-ciirc]. The benefit of this environment is the size of the laboratory. The minimal distance between two anchors is bigger than 3,5 meters; thus, the accuracy of UWB localization should be increased.

Experiments here are more complex because they are longer both in terms of duration or distance. These experiments promised to evaluate possible drift caused by using two relative localization based on IMU and odometry. As I already mentioned in previous chapters, localization is based on pure IMU drift with time and odometry drift with travelled distance. Performed experiments can be divided based on three simple trajectories of CART2 into
 \begitems
 	* moving in the rectangle shape (rectangle test),
 	* moving in the infinity shape (infinity test)
 	* and moving in bean shape (bean test).
 \enditems
 I picked a specific initial pose for each testing trajectory to repeatedly make these tests in very similar conditions. Also, rotation, rectangle, and infinity tests ran several times in a row without start/stop of the system to see how it behaves in a "long" term.
